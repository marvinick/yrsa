      <p class="card-text">"An excellent book on the economics of Artificial Intelligence. Steeped in both economics and AI/ML, this book steers clear of hype (or anti-hype), applying standard economic concepts to a rapidly emerging phenomenon. The book is geared to business readers not economists or policymakers but it has a lot to offer to everyone... Highly recommended." -- Jason Furman, former Chair of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisors on Goodreads</p>

How should companies set strategies, governments design policies, and people plan their lives for a world so different from what we know? In the face of such uncertainty, many analysts either cower in fear or predict an impossibly sunny future.</p>
